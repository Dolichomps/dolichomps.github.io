As the first in hopefully a series of tutorials I wanted to set up a base project for those who may want to follow along. To start with we are going to make a fisrt person controller using blueprints as I feel that it will help familiarize new users with the blueprint editor while still creating something of use. This tutorial will contain the following:

 1. [Setting up a blank project](#blank)
 2. [Setting up player inputs](#inputs)
 3. [Creating a FPSController blueprint](#fps)
 4. [Creating a custom game mode](#gamemode)
 5. [Creating the player movement](#movement)

We will start by making a new project. You will want to chose to create a **blueprints project** with the **blank** template. Make sure you choose no starter content for now, as we can import that later if needed.

Once the project has been created and the editor has loaded we are going to need to make 2 new folders named **Blueprints** and **Levels**. To do this simply **right click** in the content browser and choose **New Folder**.

Now that our folders are created we want to save our level. To do that click **Save Current** in the toolbar at the top of the editor upon which you will be prompted with the following dialogue:

Double click the **Levels** folder then give the level a name at the bottom, I named mine **Level01**. Then click **Save** to save our level in our Levels folder.
